Calendar Project Documentation
Each user makes a separate file that they have all their meetings in.

Each meeting has a name, date, start time, end time, and location

Each user can check their calendar against on another for time that work for meetings. 
They can outline how long they want a meeting to be, where, and when they want it. 
If the location is different the bot takes a user inputted amount of time to get there. 
After all that is done, the console will provide a numbered list of meeting times on that
day and the user can choose which meeting they want scheduled out of that list,
which will then be scheduled into their calendar file.

Things application will do
============================
This application should:
have a way to login
make a new calendar
make a new event in a calendar
import other calendars
show a person's calendar
check for available meeting times between two people's calendar (maybe multiple if that's doable)

Purpose: To advance my knowledge of C by using concepts that I've learned from my book and class, even though it would
be more efficient to use an object oriented language for this type of project.
